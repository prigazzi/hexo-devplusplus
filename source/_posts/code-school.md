### The systems of Coolblue
At Coolblue we use several systems to support you in your activities. Below you will find short descriptions of our most important systems and their applications. Your user name and password – the one you created yourself upon your first log-in on a PC – are valid for all these systems.

**Vanessa**
Vanessa is what Coolblue is all about! This is where all products, customers, and orders are registered. Also, the websites use this as a source of information.

**Ellis**
Ellis should be your saviour in times of IT-related need.  You can ask all kinds of questions here, from “help I think I broke my spacebar” to “I&#39;m not able to create orders in Vanessa”. Create an incident or a request and we will make sure you can get back to work soon. In case you&#39;re in a real hurry when things have broken down, or if you have other specific questions,  please call IT Services on extension 300 or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:itservices@coolblue.nl" target="_blank">itservices@coolblue.nl</a>.

**Suzie**
In Suzie You can turn to Suzie for all other messages, problems, and things unrelated to IT, ranging from things like “we&#39;re out of toilet paper” to “I would like to apply for a logo for my new webshop”.


**Flirt** 
Flirt is our Content Management System, providing our websites with valuable information for our customers such as product descriptions and images.


**Iris**
Iris contains all background information about our products. If you have a tip about a product, put it in iris!


**Eigen Baas**
Eigen Baas (Your Own Boss) is Coolblue’s HR portal. Here, you will find your own data, payslips, expenses claims, phone numbers, other people&#39;s birthdays, and more! Besides that, managers will find their staff members&#39; data here..


**Intranet and Blog**
On the Intranet you will find all sorts of news, including your own welcome text, together with those of other new colleagues.   The latest news involving Coolblue is posted here as well. For that all-important usability, you will also find links to all the aforementioned systems on the left-hand side of the Intranet.


**Pronet**
Feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the new impressions already, and you need to ask for some time off? You can do so in Pronet. For checking in and out at the beginning and the end of the working day, you will need Pronet as well. 

### Data storage locations
There are several locations for data storage within Coolblue. You can choose from the following locations:
Drive: Most commonly used storage for documents, spreadsheets etc. You can choose here with whom you want to share your work per document.
C: Only available on the PC you are working on, this drive is not backed up. This is the drive where the files on your desktop are stored.
U: This “drive” is located on our network and is your personal drive there. We do make back-ups of this drive.
S: This “drive” is on our network as well, but you share this one with your department. We make back-ups of this drive, too.
So, anything you store on your C:-drive, might disappear in a crash or during maintenance. But everything located on the U:-drive and S:-drive, is automatically backed-up by us. Storage space on these drives is scarce, so please think carefully about where to store your files.

### Printers

The only printer that is part of the standard configuration on the PC is a virtual PDF printer. 
This PDF printer will not make any prints on paper but will instead transfer the contents of a file to a PDF-file Low-cost and easy to e-mail! We have old-fashioned “real” printers as well, which are remarkably easy to install yourself.
In order to do so, click Start =&gt; Search =&gt; Find Printers =&gt; Find now
This will show all available printers within Coolblue. The overview will also show descriptions such as “Finance Molenlaan 13 1e verdieping” Using these descriptions, you can easily find the right printer for you.
Double-click the printer, and you will be able to start printing after installation.
### Internet usage

Within Coolblue we all share the same Internet connection. The other people using this connection will appreciate it if you don&#39;t use the Internet unnecessarily for downloading or streaming non-work-related things. This takes up a lot of bandwidth, which may cause important systems such as Vanessa to slow down. This, in turn, might jeopardize our customer guarantee of “order today, receive tomorrow”.

### Human Resources matters

If you work a set number of hours per week, your salary will be paid on the 26th of each month. If you are on an hourly wage and need to check in and out, your salary will be paid on the 6th of each month. The general drive (S:\Algemeen\Aanvullende arbeidsvoorwaarden) will provide you with more information about – among other things – calling in sick, pension schemes, and our manifesto. Please don&#39;t forget to look at this!
In case Human Resources have not yet taken a picture of you, please send a passport photograph to <a href="mailto:pz@coolblue.nl" target="_blank">pz@coolblue.nl</a> Please make sure the photo has a white background and no inconvenient items such as sunglasses or hands covering your face.

### And now putting a little of this in practice...

You&#39;ll learn the most by doing. So below some tasks for you to complete. It might be a little bit more difficult if you do not speak Dutch. Please try and otherwise ask a Dutch colleague to help out.
